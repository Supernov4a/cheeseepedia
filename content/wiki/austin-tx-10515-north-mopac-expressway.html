The Austin Mopac expressway location opened as a relocation of the 8038 Burnet Rd location sometime in November of 2006 This location opened with phase 4 and a Studio C Beta Like other stores getting phase 4 at the time, the art package included Ambassador of Fun, Grand marshal of games and the character posters. Nothing major happened to this location until 2019 when the Mopac location started their 2.0 remodel removing all phase 4 art, The Studio C beta stage and the 2000’s booths in favor of the newer booths and when this remodel concluded the former Studio C Beta stage got replaced by a 2019 dance floor and a video wall and the dance floor wasn’t a Tv slapped under the ground the 2019 dance floor had individual Led lights making Mopac’s dance floor less prone to glitching randomly like newer models of the dance floor, And as of today the Mopac location  is still going strong with it’s 2.0 design and currently has a 3 star total rating on yelp as of march 2025
